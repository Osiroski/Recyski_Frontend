## Recyski

Recyski is East Africa's first Digital Waste trading platform where you can buy and sell waste resources competitively, and ensure efficient trade execution. All recyclable resources can be traded on our platform, and we verify every company that is registered. We help you to improve the environmental impact of your resources that can be recycled and to see your waste as a resource.

Trust and reliability is the number one priority for us.

## Help to create 100% circular waste industry

Our ultimate vision is a waste-free world, where 100% of the waste we produce is recycled – a truly circular industry! We want to reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfills rapidly. Many companies claim they want to be CO2 free by 2030 or 2050… They are trying to find ways to treat their waste and be smarter about their environmental footprint. Our platform gives you the opportunity to actually sell your waste resources and secondary raw material for profit to somebody who will use them. And the best part is, you know what they will use it for. That brings us to our next point.

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
